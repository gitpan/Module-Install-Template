NAME
    Module::Install::Template - Treat module source code as a template

SYNOPSIS
        # in C<Makefile.PL>:

        process_templates(
            first_year => 2007,
            rest_from  => "$ENV{HOME}/.mitlib/standard_pod",
            start_tag  => '{%',
            end_tag    => '%}',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module, if used in the "Makefile.PL" as shown in the synopsis,
    treats module source code files as templates and processes them with the
    Template Toolkit during "make" time.

    That is, "lib/" is expected to contain templates, and "blib/lib/" will
    contain the resulting files as processed by the Template Toolkit.

    This only happens on the author's side. The end-user will not notice any
    of it.

    This module provides one subroutine: "process_templates()". It takes
    named arguments. Of these, "start_tag" and "end_tag" are treated
    specially and used for the template's start and end tag definitions.
    "rest_from" instructs this module to look for distribution attributes
    ("version", "perl_version", "author", "license", "abstract") that
    haven't been set yet in the given file.

    For example, you might have some standard POD template that you use in
    all your modules - standard stuff like installation, availability,
    author, copyright notices and so on. You could have that in the special
    directory "~/.mitlib" ("mit" here stands for
    'Module::Install::Template'). Because of that, the Module::Install
    directive "all_from" won't work properly. With "rest_from" you can
    instruct this module to take the remaining distribution attributes from
    your standard template.

    The Makefile had to be slightly patched so that "make dist" still works
    - normally "make dist" takes files from "lib/", but here these are the
    templates. We are interested in the finished files, so we override the
    relevant Makefile portions to use "blib/lib/" instead.

    This documentation is somewhat lacking - I'll try to improve it.

    Because of the "Makefile" munging, this module might not work for
    distributions that use XS or SWIG.
